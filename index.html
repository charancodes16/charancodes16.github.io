            <p>Design is more than just how a product looks on the surface. Good design involves considering all aspects of the product to ensure a positive user experience. One important aspect is the sensory stimuli that are present in the interface. To achieve this, I must balance both aesthetics and functionality, taking into account the needs of the user. Responsible design practices involve tapping into people's deep emotions, which can have a significant impact on their lives. The goal of design is not just to create something that looks good, but also to create something that works well and makes people feel good. So that should create social impact and help businesses achieve their goals.</p>

            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">Throughout my career as a product designer till now, I have worked exclusively with Fintech companies. Due to their strict policies, rules, and regulatory requirements, I am unable to showcase my work publicly. I understand that this may make it difficult for potential clients or employers to evaluate my design capabilities. However, I am happy to share my portfolio privately with those who are interested.

            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">My love for financial technology and trading began during the pandemic. As an product designer intern at <a target="_blank" href=" https://www.freecharge.in/" class="navigating-text">Freecharge</a>, I was introduced to Neo-banking, lending products, mutual funds, and equity markets. It was a thrilling experience to explore financial disciplines and wealth management at such a young age.</p>

            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">After my internship, I spent time learning more about equity markets and payment inclusions. I wasn't afraid to take risks and come up with crazy ideas for fintech, even if they failed. It was all about trusting the process and improving my learning curve.</p>

            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">Eventually, I became a founding designer at an <a target="_blank" href="#" class="navigating-text">Angel startup on Capital markets</a> where I worked closely with the founding members. This experience taught me the real faces of the financial world, including the complexities of equity markets. We ideated, designed, and built business models and functionalities, but unfortunately, Despite achieving a large market fit, the startup on hold and inactive due to a problem with the business model in relation to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rbi.org.in/" class="navigating-text">RBI</a> regulations.</p>
            
            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">Now, as a product design intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hdfcbank.com/" class="navigating-text">HDFC Bank</a>, one of the largest banks in India, I'm continuing to pursue my passion for financial inclusion and implementing my ideas. I believe that design plays a crucial role in building trust in the financial world, and I'm excited to contribute to this mission through my work at HDFC Bank. I'm looking forward to making a positive impact on people's lives in millions by designing products that are user-friendly, intuitive, and trustworthy.</p>

                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristanharris/" class="navigating-text">Tristan Harris</a>, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, is a Stanford alumnus who has been fighting for good digital inclusion in our socially connected world. His work is focused on the ways in which data enhancements and persuasive modifications of behavior captivate human attention and time, often at the expense of our well-being.
            </p>
            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">
                From 2021, I became interested in persuasive design after learning about Harris's work. I researched how to persuade people and how it works, particularly in terms of how data is connected and how algorithms are used to captivate audiences for the benefit of organizations' business growth and profit goals. Through case studies and analysis of persuasive design examples and architecture, I learned about the gaps in the human brain that make us susceptible to these techniques.
            </p>
            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">
                I drew inspiration from the work of Professor BJ Fogg's Prompt design and Daniel Kahneman's resources, among others. Using these resources, I ideated how persuasive design works in practice and created a presentation demonstrating its effectiveness. Overall, my research into persuasive design has helped me understand how our digital world is designed to captivate and how we can use this knowledge to promote more ethical and human-centered technology.

                During my intermediate high school years, I was first introduced to the dynamic and fascinating field of Human-Computer Interaction by my computer teacher. I vividly remember watching the first product conference of <a target="_blank" href="https://g.co/kgs/HckUzZ " class="navigating-text">Apple</a>, projected during one of his laboratory classes, and feeling overwhelmed by my eagerness and curiosity. Despite facing mockery from numerous students when I declared my ambition to become as powerful an Engineer as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+jobs&hl=en-IN&sxsrf=AJOqlzWpY7ByfWXqFYiymR1vbRtWvW6Smw%3A1679422856991&ei=iPUZZNuKPJG6seMPhL-IsAQ&gs_ssp=eJzj4tDP1TcwqzQuMmD04iouSS1LVcjKTyoGAEhbBtw&oq=ste&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAxgDMgQIIxAnMgQIIxAnMgQIIxAnMgoILhCxAxDUAhBDMgQILhBDMhAILhCABBAUEIcCELEDEIMBMgoILhDHARDRAxBDMgQIABBDMgoIABCxAxCDARBDMgoILhDUAhCxAxBDOgcIIxDqAhAnOgcILhDqAhAnOgwIABDqAhC0AhBDGAE6DwguEOUEEOoCELQCEEMYAToSCC4QxwEQ0QMQ6gIQtAIQQxgBOgsIABCABBCxAxCDAToHCC4Q1AIQQzoFCAAQgAQ6EQguEIMBEMcBELEDENEDEIAEOgQILhAnOhAILhCxAxCDARDHARDRAxBDSgQIQRgAUO0CWM4FYKcVaAFwAXgAgAF9iAHUApIBAzAuM5gBAKABAbABFMABAdoBBggBEAEYAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp" class="navigating-text">Steve Jobs</a>, my teacher encouraged my vision and helped me navigate my goals. This experience taught me that the most powerful weapon in the world is the human brain, and it captivated my attention.

            <p class="space-inside-paragraph">
                Since then, I have embraced the philosophy of being a "Jack of all trades" to ensure that I am not limiting myself to just one area of expertise. I have a diverse set of skills and interests, understanding that being a specialist in just one thing can sometimes hold me back. My passion for using technology to make a positive impact on society has led me to pursue my interest in design and innovation. I have learned from a variety of sources, including technology leaders, business people, professors, and other successful individuals.</p>

                While I have faced challenges and setbacks in my pursuit of creating new business ideas and innovations, I have learned a valuable lesson from my failures. I understand that failure is just an event, and not a reflection of my worth as a person. This has given me the determination and resilience to keep pushing forward and strive for success.
