            <p>I was born in India in 2002. He's a product designer currently based in India.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing a final year of a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at Kumaraguru College of Technology in Coimbatore, India.</p>

            <p id="pov-heading">My POV on design</p>
            <p>Designing products to make a better world for human experiences. Good design comes not only in UI phase its all about end-to-end product aspects. Everyone in the world sees design in the visual phase. Design is all about the experience. How the people feel about the product while having interactions. It matters the way sensory stimuli act on the interfaces on the screen. 
                <span class="pov-design--saying">‚ÄúDesign is not about how it looks it‚Äôs all about How it works‚Äù.</span>
            Humans have emotions that tap into deep emotions that we need to use responsibly.</p>

        <div class="fintech">
            <p id="fintech-heading">Fintech</p>
            <p>I love to know more about financial technology, I love to trade keeping an eye on Equity markets. </p>
            <p>I discovered trading and the markets during the pandemic times when I ventured into freecharge as a product design intern it becomes a strong connection to me on Neo-banking, Lending products, Mutual funds, and equity markets. It was a roller coaster ride when I explored financial disciplines and wealth management at the age of 19. </p>
            <p>After I left 
                <a href="https://freecharge.in" class="previous-work">Freecharge</a>
            , I took time to learn more about the equity markets and Payment inclusions. I made many crazy ideas on fintech without following rules and regulations. Even if it fails it doesn't a problem. I just trusted the process to improve my learning curve and learn from that ideas.</p>
            <p>After a gap, I ventured into the <span class="previous-work">Angel startup</span> as a Founding designer. I work closely with the founding members again on fintech which taught me the real faces of the financial world of Equity markets and Lending services. At, the startup we ideated, designed, and built business models and functionalities. Due to some reasons, the startup is on hold.</p>
            <p>Now I am working with <a href="https://www.hdfcbank.com/" target="_blank" class="HDFC">HDFC Bank</a> as a Product design intern. One of the largest banks in India. I am looking for financial inclusion and implementing the ideas.

        <div class="how-i-work">
            <p id="how-i-work-heading">So, How I work</p>
            <p>Building a bridge between work and the Learning curve? I put lots of effort into work. I believe in Discipline, Honest, and Interest. Surely, It gives more than what you think. So, the learning curve always follows everywhere in design and life. I am a deep observer. While, observing taught me many things like confidence, patience, success, and failures.</p>
        
            <p>As a designer solve people and business problems and improve the product, market fit balance, and business needs. Like, it all comes from a blank space so it all settles as a solution. Keeps on saying that go from the root of a problem as much as possible. So, why it matters is good design wants to reach at the end of the day we are using the products in some of the hard situations to onboard our tasks on small to big screens. Always he goes to the next ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù and‚ÄúWhy‚Äù?. So, It gives a solution and useful products liked by people in the world. </p>
            
            <p>My process flow is I always organize the work to sync into learning and productivity. And gives more importance to priority works, creating concepts to understand easily, I always do research before stepping into a problem for outcomes, documenting every pain point, and creating options. So if ‚ÄòA‚Äô doesn‚Äôt work will go for ‚ÄòB‚Äô. If ‚ÄòB‚Äô also doesn‚Äôt work go for C, D, E, F, and it goes on. In the end, one option will succeed.</p>
